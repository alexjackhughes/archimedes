# Archimedes AGI

Archimedes is a personal project aimed at developing a powerful and versatile AI system inspired by the concept of AGI. The project focuses on building an intelligent agent capable of performing a wide range of tasks, learning from its environment, and exhibiting general problem-solving abilities.

## Features

- **Versatile AI**: Archimedes AGI is designed to be a flexible and adaptable AI system, capable of handling various tasks across different domains.
- **Learning Capabilities**: The AGI employs state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to acquire knowledge and improve its performance over time.
- **Problem-solving Abilities**: Archimedes AGI is equipped with advanced reasoning and decision-making capabilities to solve complex problems and make informed choices.
- **Extensibility**: The project is structured in a modular way, allowing for easy integration of new functionalities and expansion of its capabilities.
- **Memory**: Archimedes has the ability to remember, and use thoughts in the future.
- **Actions**: Archimedes tries to act, and create actions on the world. Currently limited by what is capable of a computer, but the concept is anything on a computer it can also do.

General Plan

- Backstage, new thoughts are generated and the best idea is brought to the ego
- The ego looks at the thought, and tries to work out how to do it
- This gets saved in memory, for use later
- We then attempt to do the goal, and save the result of that in a folder
- We then reflect on ourselves, and try to improve

## TODO:

Rather than being seperate completions, could there instead be one massive completion that does all the parts at once?
